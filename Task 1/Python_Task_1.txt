1. Have a list of even numbers between 1 t0 100 in one line. 

2. [1, 'a',3.6000000000000001, 2, 'b', '1', 1.3999999999999999, '2'] sort this list starting with all the numbers sorted and then the characters sorted. The code should be in one line. 

3. [1,4,6,7,9,0] Get me the elements from the index as per following. All of the answers should be in one line. 
    a. First three elements

    b. Elements ommitting the first and last elements

    c. Last element

    d. Sort the list in the descending order. 

4. {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'e': 5, 'd': 4} Sort the dictionary and get the result in dictionary itself in 2 lines.

5. Make a function to get the power of the function. without using the loop. The function should have only two parameters i.e. the number itself and the power. If the power is not passed it should by default take 1. 

6.Merge the given two dictionaries in one. {'a': 1, 'c': 3},{'b': 2, 'e': 5, 'd': 4} in one line only. 

7.Merge two lists using the function of list and sort the resultant list in reverse order. [1,3,5,7,9],[2,4,6,8,10]. 

8.Compare whether the entered email is correct or not using the regular expression. An email should be in the format xyz@abc.dom or xyz@abc.dom.subdom 

9.Check a mobile number for india whehter it is a valid one or not using the regular expression. The format should be +91-1234567890.

10.Get the factors of a number given. 

11.Get LCM and GCD of given two numbers. 

12.Write a loop that does nothing(no operations) executes number of time but can be used for delay. 

13.Get Divide by Zero error handled using exception handling in python. 

14.Get the numbers which are not divisible by 2 and 3 in the range 2 to 25 using 'filter'.

15.Get the following result using numbers 1 to 10 (Use Range) as input and without using multiplication or if condition. [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20] 

16.Convert a string to a list. 'sevansu' ==> ['s','e','v','a','n','s','u']

17.Delete a variable using the built-in statement.

18.Delete an element(key-value pair) from a dictionary.

19.What will the following expressions will return.
    a. x=10, y=23 what will be z if z = x and y

    b. x=1, y='sevansu' what will be z if z = x and y

    c. x=0, y=35, w=False what will be z if z = x and y or w

    d. x=0, y=35 what will be z if z = x and y[0]

    e. x=1 ,y='sevansu' what will be z if z = x and y[0] 

20. Multiply two lists' element in one. [1,2,3,4,5][6,7,8,9,10] the result should be [6,14,24,36,50].
